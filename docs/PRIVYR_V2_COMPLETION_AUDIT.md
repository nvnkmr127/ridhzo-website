## 0. Status Corrections (2026-08-30)

A later code-level review found that several items marked **COMPLETE** below were actually mocked,
unwired, or unverified. This section is the source of truth where it conflicts with the tables below.

| Item | Prior claim | Actual state (updated) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Facebook/Meta OAuth, Page-token refresh, Callback** | COMPLETE | **Now real-when-configured + source-persisting.** Graph API calls are real and gated on `FACEBOOK_APP_ID`/`FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET`; unconfigured → fails honestly. The callback persists the Page connection as a lead source (`LeadSourceService.upsertFacebookPageSource`). **Still needs real Meta app credentials + live testing.** |
| **Meta Deauthorization webhook** | COMPLETE | **Fixed.** `signed_request` HMAC signature is now actually verified (was bypassed with `void`). |
| **Cross-Origin Iframe lead capture** | COMPLETE | **Fixed — persists** through the real ingestion pipeline (was returning a `mockLeadId`). Requires tenant + source id. |
| **Outbound webhooks: dispatcher / retry-backoff / DLQ** | COMPLETE (×3) | **Now wired end-to-end.** Real HTTP dispatch, BullMQ retry/backoff, worker started in `instrumentation.ts`, event-bus producer on `lead.created`/`lead.status_changed`, per-org endpoint table + CRUD + settings UI at `/settings/webhooks`. DLQ is in-memory (also retained in Redis via `removeOnFail:false`). |
| **Orphan services** | COMPLETE | `DuplicateResolutionService` **removed** (duplicated the live `DedupService`). `CapacityAssignmentService` + `FollowUpEscalationService` **surfaced on `/insights`**; `ReengagementCadenceService` **surfaced on the lead detail page** (cold leads). |
| **Embeddable web-form widget** | implied | **Built** — public hosted form at `/f/[sourceId]` + copy-embed snippet in Lead Sources, submitting through the ingestion pipeline (rate-limited). |
| **WhatsApp / Watxio send** | COMPLETE | Real API calls, but the wire format is assumed from the Meta-BSP pattern (`WATXIO_DOC` ×3). **Still unverified against Watxio's real API** (excluded from this pass). |

## 1. Executive Summary

Privyr V2 is a lead management platform centered strictly around **Leads** (Lead Capture → Deduplication → Assignment → Qualification → Follow-up → Automation → Messaging → Conversion). There are no Contact/Person/Organization CRM models in the core application logic.

This audit report presents a complete code-level analysis of the repository, verified through actual source code inspection and empirical execution checks (`tsc`, `eslint`, `vitest`, `playwright`, `next build`).

### Key Findings & Recent Completions
1. **Lead Discovery System (Server-side Search, Multi-Filter, Sorting, Saved Views, Kanban Scalability)**: **FIXED / VERIFIED**.
   - Server-side multi-field search across `name`, `phone` (with PostgreSQL regex digit normalization), `email` (exact, partial, domain), `company`.
   - Filter builder supporting operators (`equals`, `not_equals`, `contains`, `does_not_contain`, `is_empty`, `is_not_empty`, `before`, `after`, `between`, `gt`, `lt`) across status, owner, team, source, tags, dates, numeric scores, and custom fields.
   - Server-side sorting (`createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `name`, `status`, `owner`, `nextFollowUpAt`, `score`) and count pagination.
   - Organization-scoped Saved Views system (`saved_views` table with Drizzle migration `0007_lively_monster_badoon.sql`).
   - Kanban Board per-stage batch fetching (initial 20 per stage) with per-column "Load more" to scale past 500+ leads without memory overload.
   - Mobile-responsive filter drawer, active filter chip management, and URL-persisted filter/search/sort state.
2. **Core Lead & Event Architecture**: Clean domain-driven architecture, `globalThis` event singleton, BullMQ workers.
3. **Tenant Isolation**: Strictly enforced `organizationId` scoping across ingestion, analytics, lead queries, assignment, saved views, and bulk actions.
4. **Follow-Up Reminder Delivery**: Complete with in-app notifications, Web Push, timeline activity logging, and idempotency protection.
5. **Assignment Subsystem**: Consolidated into canonical `AssignmentService`.
